                I said before on my about me page but I am a big advocate for competition. I think competition is what
                allows for a person to improve, without it then we would all be stagnant. Thats why I love video games,
                volleyball, and golf. The desire to be better and to prove myself to not only others but myself is 
                super important to me. This allows leads to me loving growth in general, growth is one of the best feelings
                in the world. Being able to compare yourself to the past you and say wow I've grown so much is crucial as a 
                human being. Progression is vital in order to become a better version of yourself, which is why I also enjoy Reading
                or working out, along with all the other examples as it is so easy to see your progress. Listening to music is
                just relaxing so that's that.
