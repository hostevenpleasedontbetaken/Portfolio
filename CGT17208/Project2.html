            <h2>CGT 17208 || Project 2</h2>  
            <br>
            <h4>Personal Shopping Buddy</h4>
            <p>Initially, we created an ideation document. This document will be used throughout the entire project to document any ideas/research/etc.</p>
            <p>Before we could even start formulating our idea we had to consider WHY people were not shopping in stores. This led to us doing our own individual research to investigate the reasoning.</p>
            <p>After a large amount of brainstorming, we ended up with the idea of a shopping buddy. This shopping buddy would be capable of leading you throughout the store in the most efficient manner, telling you information involving details of a specific item or discounts located around the store, and able to store information that might be useful to you (allergies, shopping time limit, and product history).</p>
            <p>We then created an Interview Template in preparation for our own personal interviews. The purpose of our interview was to obtain information about the Purdue Community's personal shopping preferences, specifically understanding their difficulties, what could make the experience better, and in general what they prefer when they are shopping.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interview </h4> 
            <h4>The SmartKart</h4>
            <p>At this point, we were ready to share our ideas and receive critiques. After communicating with the class we had a shift in our thinking, rather than a shopping buddy we decided to upgrade a shopping cart to be more efficient. This led to the creation of the SmartKart, a shopping cart installed with a tablet that would be capable of all that the shopping buddy could do along with a different design.</p>
            <p>After solidifying our idea into the SmartKart we proceeded to film our video for our project. To do that we met up outside of class a few times to record and compile it all together. We created a small MIRO board in order to store the tidbits of information/keep ourselves on task along with a whimsical where we created and put together all of our UI, user task flow, and storyboarding. By the end of all of these processes, we had to compile it all together into our final presentation.</p>
            <p>Post presentation and final feedback, we took everything and put it together to complete our documentation. This documentation covers everything from where we started to where we ended including our process, purpose, prototypes, reflections, etc.</p>
            <h4>My Personal Contributions</h4>
            <p>My personal contributions to this project: At the beginning of the project I thought of a large number of ideas and features for our "shopping buddy." Afterward, I pushed for the creation of the SmartKart. As we progressed through our project we had to do our own individual research, conduct our own interviews, and compile it all together. After helping in the creation of the interview template and doing my own interview I stored it all in the MIRO where we could summarize the information. After we gained a stronghold on our ideas for the SmartKart we took the time to record our video where I would personally say I was the leading actor. After all of this was done, I created UI and a user task flow for our project. Once I had finished developing both of these we were ready to put it all into a presentation which I spent time working on as well. After our presentation, I contributed a lot to the final documentation which leads us to the end. <p>
