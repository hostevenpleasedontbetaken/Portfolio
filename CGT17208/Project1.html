            <h2>CGT 17208 || Project 1</h2>  
            <br>
            <p>Initially we created an ideation document. This document will be used up until after our midpoint presentation.</p>
            <p>We began by all doing individual research into the starship product and then brainstorming for ideas of ways we could innovate/improve starship as a whole to cater to our goals.</p>
            <p>In the end we decided on the Starship Marketplace! This idea consists of using starship as a means to sell and deliver goods between the Purdue community.</p>
            <p>We then created an Interview Template in preparation for our own personal interviews. The purpose of our interview was to obtain information about the Purdue Community's personal preferences when it comes to shopping, whether or not they create any form of product, and their thoughts on businesses/marketplaces. </p>
            <p>After this point we compiled everything together in preparation for Midpoint presentation, where we wrote a script, a prototype, and presentation through slides.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interview &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Midpoint</h4> 
           
            <p>We decided to change the application to tailer the app towards artists sharing and selling their crafts after receiving our presentation feedback, looking at our interview insights, and taking into account our group interests</p>
            <p>This led us too.... ArtMart! We created a MIRO board will be placed all of our research, questions, prototypes, and almost everything involving the creation of our product.</p>
            <p>By the end of it all we had to prepare for our final presentation so we created scenarios, finished our prototypes, discussed major benefits and how to solve potential negatives, and overall we compiled it to create the ArtMart Presentation.</p>
            <p>After completing our presentation and receiving our final feedback, we put completed our documentation which covers everything we had done from through the process including our purpose, prototypes, and reflections. </p>
