            <h4>My Personal Contributions</h4>
            <p>My personal contributions to this project: At the start of the project we all contributed a lot to the brainstorming, but I had a good mental image of the game as someone who has played RPGS before in which case I added a lot of input for our idea creation (gameplay loop, features, and gameplay systems). After conducting a lot of individual research, I compiled all of the information in a manageable and understandable manner. Along with my personal interview I compiled all of the interview data as well. Aside from this we put together our presentation in which I created a number of slides, created a storyboard, and helped with the different user flows. In the end, after our presentation, we had our final documentation where I wrote a large chunk of the information and created many pages for the final product.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>DND Quest - Ideation</h4>
            <p>Initially, we created an ideation document. This document will be used throughout the entire project to document any ideas/research/etc.</p>
            <p>Different from usual we did not start with researching everything at hand. When we first discussed the prompt we realized that it reminded us a lot of the game Pokemon Go. Since we were a group comprised of just game development majors we realized that the best option for us was to make a game involving our step counter prompt.</p>
            <p>After brainstorming for a while we came to the conclusion of Dungeons and Dragons! We initially wanted to create an RPG of sorts as we know that there is an extremely large fanbase with this. The motivation behind players wanting to play our game is to continue to progress both through game aspects but also through their physical health. We were able to easily figure out our target audience, what we want to do with the project and the problem we are solving/our solution. Along with this, we designed a gameplay loop and gameplay systems.</p>
            <p>From this point we started to do our research and created an interview template. We individually found information on the main competitor(Pokemon Go) and the effects that they have provided on their players through their game. Alongside this, we conducted interviews in the hope of understanding people with fitness watches at Purdue. We attempted to understand whether or not keeping track of their physical activity through devices affects their motivation when it comes to fitness along with in general how they feel about overall fitness.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </h4> 
            <h4>DND Quest - Compilation</h4>
            <p>From this point we had finished our interviews and primary research. After compiling this all together we were ready for our first round of feedback and critique from the class. This feedback turned out to be vital for our project. Through all of the excitement during the creation process, we forgot a large part of the prompt. We considered how to reduce cheating through a map-specific game, speed limit, and GPS tracking however we did not incorporate the step counter. The step counter evolved into the player's health bar, the more steps they take, the more health they will have (there is a cap so they canâ€™t abuse this). </p>
            <p>After solidifying our idea we began creating prototypes for our project. We developed different UI for different situations, created a storyboard, and created different user experiences/task flows. Once we finished creating all of these we put it all together for our final presentation. We incorporated all of these aspects, our gameplay loop, described our cheating preventions, and multiplayer aspects. </p>
            <p>Post presentation and final feedback, we took everything and put it together to complete our documentation. This documentation covers everything from where we started to where we ended including our process, purpose, prototypes, reflections, etc.</p>
