            <h2>CGT 245 || Information About Steven Ho</h2>
            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Hello!</p>

            <p>
                I'm Steven Ho! I've grown up surrounded by video games my entire life so naturally I developed a passion and 
                desire to work with them. Through my interest I learned to love the experience I had when exploring and completing
                a game along with wanting to provide that for other people. This is what pushed me into an interest in computer
                science and game programming. I have experience programing in Java, Python, and C but I definitely prefer Java!
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a large enthusiast for competition. I love any form of competition whether it be sports, cards, and especially
                video games. I remember one of the first games I played was Minecraft Hunger Games which sparked a love for improvement
                and trying to be the best player I could be. Through this I've played a large amount of multiplayer games such as 
                Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, Apex Legends, and many more. As much as I love these games
                there is also a similar hatred for them in which leads me to want to create similar games for people to enjoy.
                I truly feel the games you hate the most but keep playing are some of the most influential aspects of your life because
                despite that momentary desire to never want to play the game again, we always come back.
            </p>
